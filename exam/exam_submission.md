My Student ID number ends with 75, so I have exam project number 6, as $6+23\cdot 3=75$.

Please see the readme.md or readme.pdf files in the exam folder for details. Here is a quick breakdown of what I did

Part A (The given problem): **Build an interpolating routine which takes as the input the vectors {xi} and {yj}, and the matrix {Fi,j} and returns the bi-linear interpolated value of the function at a given 2D-point p=(px,py).** Success, 6 points

Part B (An idea for an extension I had): **Implement bi-cubic interpolation**. Success, 3 points

Part C (An idea for an extension I had): **Implement N-linear interpolation for a grid with arbitrary dimension N.**, Success, 1 point

In total, 10 points.

In all exercises I have verified that all boundary conditions are sattisfied within a relative and absolute precision of $10^{-5}$, I have also plotted some demonstrative examples.
