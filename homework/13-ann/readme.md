Homework 13 , Neural net
=========
Part A done, I use 8 neurons to estimate the target function, I show the result in a plot where I show both the training points and the estimate, it is certainly not perfect, but it is somewhat close.

Note, after some experimentation, I chose to use the quasi newtonian method, as the downhill simplex did not converge as well.

As other people suggested my starting guess is with the $a_i$ parameters spread evenly over the interval of the function while the other parameters are set to 1, this makes the convergence significantly faster.
