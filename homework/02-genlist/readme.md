Homework "generic list"
===========
I have done all three parts of the exercise, in part A I implement a simple dynamic sized list, in part B I optimize it by making capacity different from size, and in part C I use a linked list where each new element is stored by the previous element, requiring no resizing at the cost of not having the data in a single place.


Note, in part C I decided to use the same data as in part A and B to test the list. I also decided to implement a get(int) method so that I can get the elements by index, rather than advancing through the list one element at the time.


The output is in all cases a file out, which demonstrate that I do what you wanted us to do.
