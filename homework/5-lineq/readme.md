Homework splines
===========
I have done all three parts of the exercise, using the same data set, here chosen by me to have some interesting spikes and bumbs, and straight sections.

The calculations are done in 3 separate files. (Though they share binarySearch.dll)

In all cases, I use the object oriented approach, as I simply prefer the notation. In all cases I create an object with member functions. This means that the integral, and derivatives are seperate member functions. This was technically not asked for in part A, but I like to keep the notation the same so I did it anyway.

In all cases, I verify the integral by comparing the analytical approach to a numerical approximation.
