Homework 12 , minimization
=========
CURRENTLY DONE PART A, WILL DO NEXT PARTS IN READING PERIOD

In part A I implement Quasi-Newton optimization using numerically calculated derivatives and.

I test it to find maximum of a 1 dimensional gaussian $exp(-(x-2.0)^2)$ (max 2.0), minimum of Rosenbrocks 2D valley function (with minimum set to 1,1), and the two-dimensional Himmelblau function (4 possible minima).

In all cases I start with my guess x=0.
