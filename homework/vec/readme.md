Homework, vec
======
I have attempted to do all parts of all exercises, though it is up to you to decide whether it is done to a satisfactory degree.


The vec class has scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction, dot and scalar products and print functions defined, and the Makefile compiles as a library. The ToString method has also been overwritten for this class and an approximation function has been defined and used to test all operations.
