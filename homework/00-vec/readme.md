Homework, vec
======
I have done part A,B and C, in the same file. The output file out\_A\_B\_AND\_C.txt, demonstrates all the things which you asked for in all the pasts.


The vec class has scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction, dot and scalar products and print functions defined, and the Makefile compiles as a library. The ToString method has also been overwritten for this class and an approximation function has been defined and used to test all operations.
