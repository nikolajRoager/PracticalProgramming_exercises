Practical Programming Exercises
===================
This project contains my exercises and homehowk for the course, Practical programming and numerical methods.

As per instructed, the folder is public and the code is written in C#. However, C++ code may also be used.

The folder exercises contain the exercises, the folder homework contain the homework and the folder lectures contain the exercises done at the lectures, which I have largely copied during the lectures, they are not mandatory for this course.

Notes on C++ projects
----
The C++ projects are not considered the main exercise, they are added for comparison only.

Note the C++ projects will need to be compiled before the project can be run, (The executable and object files are added to .gitignore), since I want to work on both Arch Linux and Ubuntu. I will not include the third party libraries I may or may not use for the C++ projects here, rather only packages will be used which are available as is on the standard package managers of Arch Linux and Ubuntu (pacman and apt). If any such libraries are used, a readme file will be provided.

A makefile for each C++ project will be provided, C++ 17 will be used

Compiler version
-----
Arch Linux:  Mono C#  6.12.0.0, and GCC 11.1.0, and GNU Make 4.3
