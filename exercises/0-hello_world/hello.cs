class hello
{//I personally always drop down the brackets to the next line... it just makes it easier for me to spot them
    static void Main(){
		System.Console.Write("Hello world, Lets see how well this handles extended unicode:\nμῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος\n");
	}
}//C# does not want ; at the end of classes? well I always forget that in C++ anyway
