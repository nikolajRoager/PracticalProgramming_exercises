my max int using continued bitshift method = 2147483647
verify 2147483647+1 = -2147483648

The suggested while-loop method gives the same result, but has been commented out as it is much much slower

double epsilon = 2.22044604925031E-16, compare to 2^-52=2.22044604925031E-16
float epsilon = 1.192093E-07, compare to 2^-23=1.19209289550781E-07
sumA-1 = 0.000000e+000 should be -2.384186e-007
sumB-1 = 1.110223e-010 should be -2.384186e-007
1.0 approx 1.0
1.1 is not 1.0
1.0+tiny approx 1.0
